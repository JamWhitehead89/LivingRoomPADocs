## Induction Loop

An induction loop is fitted for use with hearing aids.

It tends to interfere with electric guitars, so might be turned off from band practice.

If anyone with a hearing impairment is present, ensure itâ€™s turned back on.

## Rack Mixer

The rack mixer performs the majority of the signal processing.

It mediates between the stagebox, main mixer (if connected), amps, kitchen media player and other inputs.

It can be controlled remotely using an iOS app, or third-party android app

## Main Mixer

The main mixer is an optional component for larger events where direct control is required

## Stagebox

The stagebox gives convenient inputs and outputs for a band.
