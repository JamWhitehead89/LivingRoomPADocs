# Rack Mixer

The rack mixer processes _all_ PA signals, including mediating between the optional mixing console and stagebox.

There are a range of presets saved in the `Scenes` section for common events. This is the most common way of using the rack mixer, simply loading in a preset.

The rack mixer can also be used with a tablet using the [X32 Mix iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/x32-mix/id542646451) or the third-party [Mixing Station XM32 Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.davidgiga1993.mixingstation&hl=en_GB). This requires the tablet to be on the `Crown PA` wireless network. _This network may not be working currently, speak to Ben for assistance._

At the heart of the rack mixer is the [routing](/docs/TheLivingRoom/Full_Instructions/Routing/Rack_Mixer) - this is what enables the console to talk to the stagebox and amps.
