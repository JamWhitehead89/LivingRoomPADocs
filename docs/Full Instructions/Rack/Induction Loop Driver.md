# Induction Loop Driver

The Living Room has an induction loop fitted, to allow people with heading aids to hear the PA system.

Due to interference with guitar amps, it may be turned off. If it needs turning back on, consider moving any equipment sensitive to the induction loop into a cupboard, or maybe the back office. Balanced equipment, like the mics, shouldn't be affected.

The front panel settings shouldn't ever need changing - if they do, consult the instruction manual.

## Connections

The input comes from `XLR Out 7` on the rack mixer which, internally, is `Bus 15`. In the Main Mixer, by default, the induction loop is fed straight off the `C/M` mono output, but this can be routed from a bus if more control is required.

The output is on an Speakon, which is part of the bundle of speaker cables. This is soldered to the induction loop tape, just inside the right of the PA Cupboard door.
