# Amps

The amps take in the outputs of the rack mixer (wherever they may've come from) and drive the speakers.

There are three amps, two QSC GX5 500 W/channel and one QSC GX3 300 W/channel.

The crossover is built into the rack mixer, using a parametric EQ on the busses.

The mix busses and XLR outputs on the rack mixer are in the same order as the amp channels, with gaps left for the spare channels.

On the rack mixer, these are fed off the main L/C/R mix.

## Amp 1 (top)

QSC GX5, drives `Left` and `Right` main speakers.

### Channel 1: Left

Gain set to -11 dB.

Run off `XLR Out 1` on the rack mixer, `bus 9`.

On the main mixer, this is fed by `Mix L`.

### Channel 2: Right

Gain set to -11 dB.

Run off `XLR Out 2` on the rack mixer, `bus 10`.

On the main mixer, this is fed by `Mix R`.

## Amp 2

QSC GX3, drives `F. Fill`, the small centre fill on the front wall.

### Channel 1: F. Fill

Gain set to -12 dB.

Run off `XLR Out 3` on the rack mixer, `bus 11`.

On the main mixer this is fed by `M/C`.

### Channel 2: Spare

This spare channel is intended for the right rear speaker, which would go above the cafe area. It should be the other JBL Control 25-1 (same as the front fill).

## Amp 3 (bottom)

QSC GX3, drives `Sub`, the subwoofer set into the front wall toward the fire exit.

### Channel 1: Sub

Gain set to -4 dB.

Run off `XLR Out 5` on the rack mixer, `bus 13`.

On the main mixer this is fed by `M/C`.

### Channel 2: Spare

This spare channel is intended for the left rear speaker, which would go above the main door. It should be a JBL Control 29 AV, although a Control 28 may suffice.
