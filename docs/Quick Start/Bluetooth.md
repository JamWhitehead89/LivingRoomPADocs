# How to Get Bluetooth working

## Pairing Phone

To pair your phone, or any other similar device, follow the steps below.

1. Go into the cupboard next to the kitchen'd drop-down counter
2. Make sure `source/media` is set to bluetooth
3. Press the `pairing` button (note the label is above the button
4. Do the pairing stuff in your phone's bluetooth settings. This is beyond the scope of this document.
5. You're now set

## Setting up the PA system

The PA system should already be set up. To check, play some audio. If it comes out of the speakers, you are finished. Otherwise, follow these instructions:

1. Go into the PA Cupboard
2. Turn on the switch on the black extension lead screwed to the wall
3. Press the `scenes` button on the right of the screen
4. Press the right arrow `>` to select the `scenes` tab
5. Use the left-most encoder undred the screen (labeled `load`) to scroll through the scenes and select `Normal`
6. Press the encoder in to load the scene. Use the right arrow `>` to confirm if asked

## Other Inputs

The player in the kitchen can also play:

- CDs
- USBs
- SD cards
- Aux/headphone/line in 3.5mm jack

Simply press the `source/media` button to choose the input. It is polite to return the source to bluetooth once finished.
