# Video

The Living Room video system consists of two screens that can be used together or individually.

## Displaying on One Screen

To use just one screen, plug an HDMI cable into the HDMI port on the wall below the TV

## Displaying the Same Signal on Both Screens

The video-over-cat5 system allows an HDMI or VGA signal to be shown from almost anywhere in the room to both screens simultaneously. It will also send autio to the main PA speakers (see below)

1. Get the cat5 converter box from the PA cupboard
2. Plug the ethercon cable from the port on the box to a `[location] Video` socket on the wall. These are at the `Front`, `Left`, `Rear`, `Cafe` and `Right`
3. In the PA cupboard, on the patch panel, there is a short cable in the `Video` socket on the patch panel. Plug the other end into the port the matches the label where you plugged the box in.
4. Whilst there, ensure the rack is on.
5. Plug your laptop into the HDMI or VGA port on the converter box. If necessary, press the `source` button to change from HDMI to VGA
6. You should now have video on the screens. If not, they may need turning on, and the correct source selecting.

## Audio

If the audio doesn't come on automatically, check the following

### HDMI audio

Check the computer is outputing audio over HDMI. The 3.5mm (headphone jack) on the converter box may not work with HDMI

### VGA audio

Ensure a 3.5mm (headphone socket) cable is going from the laptop to the converter box - VGA cannot carry sound on its own.

### PA Setup

1. Go into the PA Cupboard
2. Turn on the switch on the black extension lead screwed to the wall
3. Press the `scenes` button on the right of the screen
4. Press the right arrow `>` to select the `scenes` tab
5. Use the left-most encoder undred the screen (labeled `load`) to scroll through the scenes and select `Normal`
6. Press the encoder in to load the scene. Use the right arrow `>` to confirm if asked
